Before you can build and run the project, you must install the following software on your machine:

Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en

Google Chrome - https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/

A text editor or IDE of your choice. Visual Studio Code is a very popular option, but feel free to use a different one.

Installing and running the Project After cloning the repo on your machine, open a terminal, CD into the project's root folder and run below

$ npm install # Installs test dependencies

$ npm run test # Run tests in headless browser, Cypress default runner/browser

Running tests with Cypress Runner window - This is only required when you want to see the tests running visibly. $ npm run debug

Then click on e2e testing option

And click on browser of choice
